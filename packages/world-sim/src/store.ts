   *
   * - Log order is commit order. Nothing is ever inserted behind a row a

   *   miss a write that has not committed yet, or one a lagging replica has
   *   not caught up to (see `withholdNextEvent`) — but never self-inconsistent.
   *   Staleness collapses into lag, and lag is what the optimistic-concurrency
   *   fence can see; a hole is what it cannot.
   *
   * What it costs is the property the boundary mint was buying: a write no
   * longer knows where it will land until it lands. Off by default, because
   * the simulation's job is to model the world that exists. Turning it on
   * answers the other question — which of these failures survive if it didn't?
   *
