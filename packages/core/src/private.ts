/**
 * Awaits, in strict event-log order, every still-registered delivery that is

 * behind (see {@link DEFER_BEHIND}), so that this resolution is handed to the
 * workflow only after all relevant earlier-in-log deliveries have been. This
 * is what keeps a `Promise.race` — or the ULID a follow-up `useStep` draws on
 * a concurrent branch — deterministic and aligned with the committed event
 * log, independent of microtask-hop counts, hydration time, or race-argument
 * order. When this delivery does have to wait, it also yields a macrotask
 * afterwards so the earlier delivery's consumer can run to its own next
 * suspension point first; see the comment at that `await` for why ordering the
 * `resolve()` calls alone is not enough.
 *
 * What counts as "defers behind" is {@link gatesOn}, shared with
 * {@link computeResolvesOnItsOwn} so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * One asymmetry: a STEP result skips any earlier delivery that is UNARMED,
 * i.e. a buffered hook payload no consumer has claimed. Such a payload is
 * delivered only when the workflow next reads the hook, and reaching that read
 * very commonly requires the step result itself (`await stepX()` before the
 * read). Gating the step on it would stall the workflow until the barrier's
 * idle safety net fires, which then releases every delivery queued behind that
 * payload at once — losing exactly the race this ordering exists to protect.
 * Waits and hooks keep gating on unclaimed payloads: for them, waiting for the
 * claim IS the ordering guarantee (a `wait_completed` must not preempt a
 * payload the log ordered first).
 *
 * The skip is direct, never transitive. A step still gates on an earlier ARMED
 * wait or hook, including one that is itself parked behind an unclaimed
 * payload. Skipping those too would invert log order for the commonest shape
 * there is: a workflow that creates a hook it does not read on this branch,
 * races `step` against `sleep`, and has the log say the sleep won. The step
 * would then overtake the wait, both branches would swap the correlation ids
 * they draw next, and replay would diverge — see
 * `step-delivery-ordering.test.ts`. Waiting instead is safe because the
 * payload's own idle safety net retires it and the whole chain then delivers
 * in log order; {@link hasParkedCommittedDelivery} deliberately reports such a
 * step as not self-resolving so that idle stays reachable.
 *
 * "The whole chain then delivers in log order" rests on the PAYLOAD's safety
 * net observing idle before the net of the wait parked behind it. If the
 * wait's net fired first, the step's gate would open while the wait was still
 * parked on the payload barrier and the inversion above would reappear. Within
 * one drain window that order is structural, and carried by FIFO of the
 * safety-net polls: nets arm via `setTimeout` in log order during synchronous
 * consumption, each polling round re-arms through `promiseQueue.then(...)` in
 * the order the checks ran, and each net that fires flips
 * {@link hasParkedCommittedDelivery} back to true, re-blocking the rest until
 * the released delivery completes. Replay — where divergence manifests —
 * always consumes the log in one window. Do not "optimize" the net scheduling
 * in a way that breaks that per-window FIFO.
