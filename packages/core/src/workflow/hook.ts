/**
 * Constructs a `Run` handle for the run that owns a conflicting hook
 * token, for resolution through `hook.getConflict()`.
 *
 * The instance is created through the serialization class registry on
 * the VM's globalThis — the same channel that revives serialized `Run`
 * instances (e.g. `start()` return values crossing from a step into the
 * workflow). The registered class is the VM bundle's plugin-compiled
 * `Run`, whose methods are durable step proxies — safe to call from
 * workflow code — and construction goes through its
 * `WORKFLOW_DESERIALIZE` hook, exactly as the `Instance` reviver would.
 *
 * Returns `null` when a real `Run` cannot be constructed: the conflict
 * event lacks `conflictingRunId` (written by an old world), or the VM's
 * registry has no `Run` (a context that never evaluated the
 * workflow-mode `create-hook` module, which aliases it under
 * `RUN_CLASS_ID`). `getConflict` awaiters then reject with
 * `HookConflictError` instead of resolving with a value that doesn't
 * honor the `Run` contract.
