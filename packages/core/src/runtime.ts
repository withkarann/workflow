                   * with its own event log would otherwise cycle restarts →
                   * re-invoke → restarts with no run-level bound. The chain is
                   * therefore counted on the message itself, in the same way
                   * replay divergences are, and fails the run once exhausted.

                   * The counter only advances on hops that enqueue a new message
                   * (see `reinvoke`). A redelivery-based hop keeps the same body
                   * and so the same count, but it also keeps advancing
                   * `metadata.attempt`, which the max-delivery check at the top
                   * of the handler already bounds — and the delay below is what
                   * makes that budget span real time rather than being burned in
